    Solves any (supported) kind of ordinary differential equation and
    system of ordinary differential equations.

    For single ordinary differential equation
    =========================================

    It is classified under this when number of equation in ``eq`` is one.
    **Usage**

        ``dsolve(eq, f(x), hint)`` -> Solve ordinary differential equation
        ``eq`` for function ``f(x)``, using method ``hint``.

    **Details**

        ``eq`` can be any supported ordinary differential equation (see the
            :py:mod:`~sympy.solvers.ode` docstring for supported methods).
            This can either be an :py:class:`~sympy.core.relational.Equality`,
            or an expression, which is assumed to be equal to ``0``.

        ``f(x)`` is a function of one variable whose derivatives in that
            variable make up the ordinary differential equation ``eq``.  In
            many cases it is not necessary to provide this; it will be
            autodetected (and an error raised if it could not be detected).

        ``hint`` is the solving method that you want dsolve to use.  Use
            ``classify_ode(eq, f(x))`` to get all of the possible hints for an
            ODE.  The default hint, ``default``, will use whatever hint is
            returned first by :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.classify_ode`.  See
            Hints below for more options that you can use for hint.

        ``simplify`` enables simplification by
            :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.ode.odesimp`.  See its docstring for more
            information.  Turn this off, for example, to disable solving of
            solutions for ``func`` or simplification of arbitrary constants.
            It will still integrate with this hint. Note that the solution may
            contain more arbitrary constants than the order of the ODE with
            this option enabled.

        ``xi`` and ``eta`` are the infinitesimal functions of an ordinary
            differential equation. They are the infinitesimals of the Lie group
            of point transformations for which the differential equation is
            invariant. The user can specify values for the infinitesimals. If
            nothing is specified, ``xi`` and ``eta`` are calculated using
            :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.infinitesimals` with the help of various
            heuristics.

        ``ics`` is the set of initial/boundary conditions for the differential equation.
          It should be given in the form of ``{f(x0): x1, f(x).diff(x).subs(x, x2):
          x3}`` and so on.  For power series solutions, if no initial
          conditions are specified ``f(0)`` is assumed to be ``C0`` and the power
          series solution is calculated about 0.

        ``x0`` is the point about which the power series solution of a differential
          equation is to be evaluated.

        ``n`` gives the exponent of the dependent variable up to which the power series
          solution of a differential equation is to be evaluated.

    **Hints**

        Aside from the various solving methods, there are also some meta-hints
        that you can pass to :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.dsolve`:

        ``default``:
                This uses whatever hint is returned first by
                :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.classify_ode`. This is the
                default argument to :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.dsolve`.

        ``all``:
                To make :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.dsolve` apply all
                relevant classification hints, use ``dsolve(ODE, func,
                hint="all")``.  This will return a dictionary of
                ``hint:solution`` terms.  If a hint causes dsolve to raise the
                ``NotImplementedError``, value of that hint's key will be the
                exception object raised.  The dictionary will also include
                some special keys:

                - ``order``: The order of the ODE.  See also
                  :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.deutils.ode_order` in
                  ``deutils.py``.
                - ``best``: The simplest hint; what would be returned by
                  ``best`` below.
                - ``best_hint``: The hint that would produce the solution
                  given by ``best``.  If more than one hint produces the best
                  solution, the first one in the tuple returned by
                  :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.classify_ode` is chosen.
                - ``default``: The solution that would be returned by default.
                  This is the one produced by the hint that appears first in
                  the tuple returned by
                  :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.classify_ode`.

        ``all_Integral``:
                This is the same as ``all``, except if a hint also has a
                corresponding ``_Integral`` hint, it only returns the
                ``_Integral`` hint.  This is useful if ``all`` causes
                :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.dsolve` to hang because of a
                difficult or impossible integral.  This meta-hint will also be
                much faster than ``all``, because
                :py:meth:`~sympy.core.expr.Expr.integrate` is an expensive
                routine.

        ``best``:
                To have :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.dsolve` try all methods
                and return the simplest one.  This takes into account whether
                the solution is solvable in the function, whether it contains
                any Integral classes (i.e.  unevaluatable integrals), and
                which one is the shortest in size.

        See also the :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.classify_ode` docstring for
        more info on hints, and the :py:mod:`~sympy.solvers.ode` docstring for
        a list of all supported hints.

    **Tips**

        - You can declare the derivative of an unknown function this way:

            >>> from sympy import Function, Derivative
            >>> from sympy.abc import x # x is the independent variable
            >>> f = Function("f")(x) # f is a function of x
            >>> # f_ will be the derivative of f with respect to x
            >>> f_ = Derivative(f, x)

        - See ``test_ode.py`` for many tests, which serves also as a set of
          examples for how to use :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.dsolve`.
        - :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.dsolve` always returns an
          :py:class:`~sympy.core.relational.Equality` class (except for the
          case when the hint is ``all`` or ``all_Integral``).  If possible, it
          solves the solution explicitly for the function being solved for.
          Otherwise, it returns an implicit solution.
        - Arbitrary constants are symbols named ``C1``, ``C2``, and so on.
        - Because all solutions should be mathematically equivalent, some
          hints may return the exact same result for an ODE. Often, though,
          two different hints will return the same solution formatted
          differently.  The two should be equivalent. Also note that sometimes
          the values of the arbitrary constants in two different solutions may
          not be the same, because one constant may have "absorbed" other
          constants into it.
        - Do ``help(ode.ode_<hintname>)`` to get help more information on a
          specific hint, where ``<hintname>`` is the name of a hint without
          ``_Integral``.

    For system of ordinary differential equations
    =============================================

   **Usage**
        ``dsolve(eq, func)`` -> Solve a system of ordinary differential
        equations ``eq`` for ``func`` being list of functions including
        `x(t)`, `y(t)`, `z(t)` where number of functions in the list depends
        upon the number of equations provided in ``eq``.

    **Details**

        ``eq`` can be any supported system of ordinary differential equations
        This can either be an :py:class:`~sympy.core.relational.Equality`,
        or an expression, which is assumed to be equal to ``0``.

        ``func`` holds ``x(t)`` and ``y(t)`` being functions of one variable which
        together with some of their derivatives make up the system of ordinary
        differential equation ``eq``. It is not necessary to provide this; it
        will be autodetected (and an error raised if it could not be detected).

    **Hints**

        The hints are formed by parameters returned by classify_sysode, combining
        them give hints name used later for forming method name.

    Examples

    Eq(f(x), C1*sin(3*x) + C2*cos(3*x))

    >>> t = symbols('t')
    >>> x, y = symbols('x, y', cls=Function)
    >>> eq = (Eq(Derivative(x(t),t), 12*t*x(t) + 8*y(t)), Eq(Derivative(y(t),t), 21*x(t) + 7*t*y(t)))
    >>> dsolve(eq)
    [Eq(x(t), C1*x0(t) + C2*x0(t)*Integral(8*exp(Integral(7*t, t))*exp(Integral(12*t, t))/x0(t)**2, t)),

    exp(Integral(7*t, t))*exp(Integral(12*t, t))/x0(t)))]
    >>> eq = (Eq(Derivative(x(t),t),x(t)*y(t)*sin(t)), Eq(Derivative(y(t),t),y(t)**2*sin(t)))
    >>> dsolve(eq)
